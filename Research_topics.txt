Ideas for research

-Straightforward LL research in small sharks (i.e. morphological, neurophysiological, behavioral responses)
-Shark swimming behaviors in response to turbulent changes in fluid flow (kinematics, fluid mechanics)
-Imapct of body type or specific anatomical features (esp. fins) on swimming behaviors and response to simpler changes in fluid flow (morphology, kinematics, fluid mechanics)
-Fluid pressure detection in sharks (locations and stimulus thresholds of detection, similar to Elias's work)
-Visual motion tracking and responset to turbulence (i.e. when a shark is chasing a prey item, and turbulent waters disrupt its hunting behavior, how does it escape?)
-*New idea after talking with Collette* Look into bonnethead and sharpnose shark environments and learn about what the fluid dynamic environment is like 
  (are they coastal? In reef systems? Calm or choppy waters?). Base research questions on that.

Current work pursuant of those ideas:
Meeting with Gareth to talk about influence of denticles on fluid flow (esp. around LL pores), and the innvervation of denticles
Meeting with Rob to learn more about the museum's collections (esp. clear staining of sharks)
Read up on current knowledge of the LL in sharks
Read up on current knowledge of LL in bony fish (to help form hypotheses)
Learn about sharpnose sharks and bonnetheads specifically (according to Collette's advice)
Lean how to do fish surgery from colleague
Sit in on Animal Behavior, Fluid Mechanics, and Ichthyology to learn overviews of the subjects and gain broader perspectives
Find time to travel to Whitney for work with projections of 'prey items'
Program a projection of a 'prey item' moving around time in Whitney
